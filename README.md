STM32 SD Card Project

This STM32 project demonstrates how to interface an SD card using the SPI peripheral and FatFs file system on the STM32F412ZG. It includes basic read/write operations and file handling (create, write, read .txt files) using the HAL library.

Configured and built with STM32CubeIDE, using HAL drivers and FatFs middleware.
